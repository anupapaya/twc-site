# Join us

Our Slack is governed by the principles and rules in our [Community Guide](/community-guide). By joining, you agree to follow them. If you don't meet these requirements you should consider joining the [Allies slack](https://join.slack.com/t/techworkersco-4fm8079/shared_invite/zt-nbqg4212-Zzzwrrpl8gYm8HHyla16og).

<div class='p-3 marg-b-3 border'>
  <h2 class="txt-1"><b>STOP! Please read!</b></h2>
  Before joining the Slack, please keep in mind that you will be manually vetted according to our principles above before you are allowed in. Sometimes this can take a couple days. Vetting is done by volunteers, please be patient with us! Only submit the form once and if you meet our requirements you will get in!
</div>

# Don't qualify for the Slack? Rejected?

If you're a manager or someone not in tech, but you're a supporter of TWC, we recently setup a new 'Managers & Allies' slack you may join that is open to anybody [here](https://join.slack.com/t/techworkersco-4fm8079/shared_invite/zt-nbqg4212-Zzzwrrpl8gYm8HHyla16og).
