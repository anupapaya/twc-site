On April 24th, we are hosting our first ever Solidarity With Labor Forum. The mission of the Democratic Party and the Labor Movement is one in the same. It is imperative to be engaged with the grievances of working America, in order to insure we maintain a solidarity with our people. Please join us on April 24th, at San Benito Free Library 470 5th st. Hollister CA, 95023. We are honored to have the presence of respected organizations, such as LiUNA, CWA, Silicon Valley Rising, Unite Here, and the Tech Workers Coalition.
