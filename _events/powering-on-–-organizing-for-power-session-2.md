Learn about the history of organizing, what it looks like in action, and what you can do as a tech worker. 

POWERING ON is a political education and organizing program for tech workers put together by the Tech Workers Coalition (TWC). This is a 6-week program for tech workers to build conceptual frameworks for analyzing the tech industry's relationship to global structures of oppression and develop concrete strategies for organizing. **[Mandatory registration](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZEkcu6ppz8tG9ONKhxUk4u5mU7qw_idjTVX)** with Zoom
