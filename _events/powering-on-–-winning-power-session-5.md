POWERING ON is a political education and organizing program for tech workers put together by the Tech Workers Coalition (TWC). This is a 6-week program for tech workers to build conceptual frameworks for analyzing the tech industry's relationship to global structures of oppression and develop concrete strategies for organizing. **[Mandatory registration](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZcpdOitrD4jE9bFLzi1YJUCVzPcuLfisFrJ)** with Zoom

POWERING ON will begin on April 2, meeting every Tuesdays at 5pm PT / 8pm ET. The program is designed to build on each week, so consecutive attendance is ideal, but not required. We'll be meeting virtually.

5. Winning Power (Apr 30 @ 5pm pt / 8pm et) - What does a “win” look like in organizing?    
6. Nurturing Power (May 7 @ 5pm pt / 8pm et) - How do we take care of each other?
