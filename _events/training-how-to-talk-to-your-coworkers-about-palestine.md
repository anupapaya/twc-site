Do you want to talk about Palestine at your workplace but donâ€™t know where to begin?

We are hosting a virtual training on April 13 to learn how to have 1:1 conversations with your coworkers and invite them to join in building the labor movement to stop the genocide in Gaza!

Register now: [bit.ly/maydaytraining](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUqde-oqDoiEtI9M-coBi5Xll_WRxO2AoD3)

Join tech workers and the broader Bay Area labor movement on May Day. Bay Area Labor for Palestine is organizing a Tech Worker Contingent and will be marching on May Day (May 1st) in Oakland. Hope to see you at the march and in the coalition!
