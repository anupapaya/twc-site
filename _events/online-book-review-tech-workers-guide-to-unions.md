In this 90 minute online-call, you will learn more about "[The Tech Worker's Guide to Unions](https://www.amazon.de/Tech-Workers-Guide-Unions/dp/9083386945)" book by Janneke Parrish, about their experiences organizing [\#AppleTogether](https://appletogether.org/) and supporting other tech companies in workplace organizing. 

In 2021, Apple fired Janneke for their work #AppleToo, a movement that brought the discrimination, harassment, and retaliation that many Apple workers were experiencing to light. Since then, they've continued to found the solidarity union #AppleTogether which connects Apple organizing initiatives around the world together.  

Whether you're newly interested in unionizing, or a veteran organizer, this online call is for you! This talk will be streamed and recorded. Detailed to be announced! [Mandatory registration over Zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZcpd--sqzkqHtUUvK-u-vexE6hsAby7T1rs)
