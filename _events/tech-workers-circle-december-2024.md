TWCâ€™s monthly workers circles are a space for workers at all levels of experience organizing to gather, share experiences,  and learn from one another about how to organize our coworkers. This is a space to discuss all aspects of workplace organizing, from just starting a campaign to negotiating contracts or beyond.
