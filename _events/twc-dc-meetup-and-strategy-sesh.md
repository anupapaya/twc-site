We'll be talking about takeaways from Circuit Breakers, doing some brainstorming/powermapping about building about tech labor power in DC, and building community. Welcome to anyone working in the tech industry - from software engineers to Amazon warehouse workers, product managers, AI data taggers, tech equity advocates, and data center maintenance staff. We're building power wall-to-wall!
