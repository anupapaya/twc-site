# What's a worker center? Understanding the union-alternative and strategizing for our post-workplace future
**Saturday, July 29, 2017, 4-6PM**

### Description

Even AFL-CIO union leaders say that unions have to be re-imagined for workers to have meaningful power in our evolving and uncertain future (e.g. gig economy, contingent workforce, automation) (another example is SEIU funding the Fight for 15 even though it does not entirely correlate with the needs of its constituents). We are also suspicious of and dissatisfied with the parameters the NLRB has set for worker organizing. The goal of this session is to understand more of the legal framework of collective bargaining, to digest how various modes of organization address different needs, and imagine which new organizing alternatives could be realized most immediately.
