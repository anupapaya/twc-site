## Summer Learning Club 2017 ☀️

Summer Learning Club was an experimental, bi-weekly reading and discussion group that formed in Summer 2017 to explore answers to the following question:

**How can worker self-organization improve the working lives of people in and around the tech industry?**

There were sessions based on worker's inquiry, labor history, critique of the tech industry, and case studies from other successful movements.
