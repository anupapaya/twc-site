# TWC Site
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9ea4d7f9-fe8b-438b-b972-c3ba1076eae2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/techworkersco/deploys)

This repository is responsible for most content visible on the website [techworkerscoalition.org](https://techworkerscoalition.org). The site is made with a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in a language called Ruby.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
2. Start a local server: `bundle exec jekyll serve`

Open a browser to localhost:8080

## Add your city

If your country/city's TWC chapter is not mentioned in the website, link to it on the homepage [here](_layouts/home.html) and if you want a local markdown page (as opposed to external link) see the other examples [here](city_local).

## Add a press mention

Inside [`_data/press.yml`](_data/press.yml) file, add a media entry, with date format in `YYYY-MM-DD`

## Translation

I18n (internationalization) is made available with the [jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin](https://github.com/kurtsson/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin/). When a page has a translated version available, a link will show up on the top right if you use the [default_translate](_layouts/default_translate.html) layout. English is the default language, while other languages have their two letter ISO code prefixed, for example [TechWorkersCoalition.org/ru](https://TechWorkersCoalition.org/ru) for Russian.

### Adding new language
1. Add new language key to [en.yml](_i18n/en.yml)
2. Add two letter iso code in [config](_config.yml). The order here determines the order shown on the page. English must be first.
3. Inside the [i18n](_i18n) directory create a
  - `LANGUAGE/` (where LANGUAGE is two letter ISO code for that language)
  - `LANGUAGE.yml` with the language key and value in its own language, for example `es: Espa√±ol`

Note, only the default [en.yml](_i18n/en.yml) must contain the names of each language. The other language yml files contain just their own language key.

To include only certain languages, specify the exact language keys you want inside the page front matter. For example `languages: ["en", 'ja']`
