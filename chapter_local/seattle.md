# Seattle Tech Workers Coalition

<div class="blurb">
  <p>We are the Seattle local of Tech Workers Coalition.</p>
  <p>We strive to build a tech industry that serves the people through rank & file led organizing and action.</p>
  <p>We connect Seattle tech workers throughout the industry to each other, to the labor movement, and to larger working class struggles across the world.</p>
  <p>Check the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/techworkerscoalition/">Tech Workers Coaltion instagram</a> or <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/events">the global events page</a> for updates on our actions and events!</p>
  <p>We welcome current / former tech workers, tech-adjacent workers, and any non-tech workers interested in organizing or community projects.</p>
  <p>Want to talk to us? Join #local-seattle in the <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/subscribe/">TWC slack</a> or send us a email: hello@techworkerscoalition.org
